I decided to stop modifying this code momentarily.
Instead, there will be a new version of project, Mathcon, with full LaTeX and HTML documents.

To compile "main", do:
ghc -o main main.hs -icftdef -icfteg -icftfun -igenlib
To compile "daybreak", in the subdirectory "daybreak" do:
ghc -o daybreak daybreak.hs -i../genlib
